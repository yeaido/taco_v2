# How it works #

* TACO locates your local files written by EVE client (it's normally in  My Documents/EVE/Logs)
* TACO reads your game log for combat monitor and chatlog for intel channels
* intel channels can be customized at [Config]->[Channels]
* when somebody links a system or some text you set up as trigger TACO will play a sound to notify you
* 30 seconds after you leave combat, TACO will play a sound to notify you (if you enable the anomaly monitor)
* custom text alert works both for chatlog and gamelog: If you set a name as the trigger text then if someone by that name attacks you then TACO will play a sound
