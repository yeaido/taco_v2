* **Still in development**

####To Do:####
* Switch or add intel channels that are in regions closer to home
* BUG FIXES

####Known Bugs:####
* Monitors going to sleep may cause OpenGL to bug out when monitors wake up (rare)
* When upgrading from v0.4.x to v0.5.x, configs are not imported, sorry. I stuffed something up, but further config upgrades shouldn't be an issue.
